Every execution has a synchronization order. A synchronization order is a total order over all of the synchronization actions of an execution. For each thread t, the synchronization order of the synchronization actions (ยง17.4.2) in t is consistent with the program order (ยง17.4.3) of t.

Synchronization actions induce the synchronized-with relation on actions, defined as follows:

- An unlock action on monitor m synchronizes-with all subsequent lock actions on m (where "subsequent" is defined according to the synchronization order).

- A write to a volatile variable v (ยง8.3.1.4) synchronizes-with all subsequent reads of v by any thread (where "subsequent" is defined according to the synchronization order).

- An action that starts a thread synchronizes-with the first action in the thread it starts.

- The write of the default value (zero, false, or null) to each variable synchronizes-with the first action in every thread.
	Although it may seem a little strange to write a default value to a variable before the object containing the variable is allocated, conceptually every object is created at the start of the program with its default initialized values.

- The final action in a thread T1 synchronizes-with any action in another thread T2 that detects that T1 has terminated.
	T2 may accomplish this by calling T1.isAlive() or T1.join().

- If thread T1 interrupts thread T2, the interrupt by T1 synchronizes-with any point where any other thread (including T2) determines that T2 has been interrupted (by having an InterruptedException thrown or by invoking Thread.interrupted or Thread.isInterrupted).

The source of a synchronizes-with edge is called a release, and the destination is called an acquire.
